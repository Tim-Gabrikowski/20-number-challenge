# 20-number-challenge

Online Version of the 20-Number Challenge

## Rules of the Game

The rules are simple: You have 20 slots in a List and you get 20 random Numbers, one at a time. The goal is to fill out the List with these numbers. Once a number is placed, it can not move. The only catch is, that the list has to be sorted in the end.
